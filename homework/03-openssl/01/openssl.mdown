How do you obtain the SHA-1 hash of a file by using the openssl program? Describe the command line parameters.

The command to calculate the sha1 of a file is:

    $ openssl sha1 <file>

There are also parameters that allow us to specify other message digest algorithms, like md5 or sha512 (etc):

    $ openssl sha1 -sha512 <file>


If we want to output the sha in a binary file (preferably to a file) we can use:

    $ openssl sha1 -binary -out <outfile> <file>
